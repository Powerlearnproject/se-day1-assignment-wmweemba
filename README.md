Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of using a systematic approach to the planning, design, development and maintenance of high-quality software. This process starts from the idea phase through to the execution and maintenance of the final software product.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Requirements gathering, Design and Testing.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering of the need or purpose of the software to be created.
Design: Using the requirements that are developed, the software is designed to create a skeleton of what the software will look like. The design will guide the process of doing the actual code.
Implementation: Using the design, code is written to build out the software and make it do what is expected.
Testing: Testing must be done to verify that the software/code is running as expected, with the expected results/outputs.
Deployment: The software is taken live and deployed to be used in the real world.
Maintenance: This is an ongoing process to make sure that the software continues to run as expected. Updates and patches may be used to keep the software working as expected.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology takes a structured step-by-step approach to development with each stage needing to be completed before moving to the next one, While Agile Methodology is more flexible and looks to use an iterative incremental approach to quickly make changes as in a collaborative manner. An agile approach would be more ideal for a project that has a very short timeline or deadline, while a waterfall model can be used for an especially complex project that needs time to be invested to get each stage right.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and building the actual software based on the requirements and design stages.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for high levels of software quality by designing the appropriate tests and test scenarios to test the software.
Project Manager: Responsible for driving the entire project and making sure that each member does their specific role. The PM also ensures that the project is kept on track and delivered on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is important as it is the tool used to write out code and debug that code as well as run it. An example is VS Code.
A VCS is important because it allows developers to keep track of changes to their code in an organised manner. This allows for easier collaboration with other developers and other stakeholders. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some challenges include Tight deadlines and changing requirements which make it difficult to deliver the software project within the agreed time and budget.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing of specific software components for accuracy
Integration: testing how specific components interact and work with one another and with other systems or software
System: Testing of the entire system as a whole and how it is working
Acceptance: Testing the software against the expected output or expected result by the user or customers of that software/system


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting statements or questions used to instruct or query the AI to get a desired output. The process of crafting the statements/prompts is prompt engineering. It is important because the more effective the prompt engineering, the better the quality of responses generated by the AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: How do you write a book?
Specific: Provide me with a step-by-step guide to writing an award-winning non-fiction book with clear and concise steps including links to resources to help me at each stage of the process.

The specific prompt requests the AI to clearly list steps to follow one by one including resources to help me write a book that will be award-winning. The second prompt specifies the type of book so that more accurate steps are provided.
